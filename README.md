## **Hi there 👋**

I am a multidisciplinary researcher with an extensive background in the biophysical and biochemical characterization of membrane proteins and lipid membranes. I want to apply the knowledge gained through my work to develop life-saving medicine.

My work combines and intersects physics, chemistry, biochemistry, computer science, medicine, engineering, mathematics, and structural biology.

I use GitHub to collaborate on various projects related to my research work.

My work has a main emphasis on G-protein-coupled receptors (**GPCRs**), which make the largest family of membrane proteins in the human genome and are involved in almost all physiological and pathophysiological processes of the body. Through my work, I have been trying to understand how various factors in the cellular environment modulate the activation of GPCRs and develop ways to extract this information.
